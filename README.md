# Satellite Remote Sensing in Python

Here is a repository of all of my satellite/remote sensing processing scripts that I've written over the past couple of years! :-)

---

### What scripts are available?
Currently, there are scripts for:

- **TROPOMI**: Methane, Water/HDO, Sulfur Dioxide, Formaldehyde, and Nitrogen Dioxide
- **Vegetation Indices**: Work-in-progress, but will have SIF, SIF (downscaled), and VIIRS NDVI/NIR. Maybe CCI?
- **Other**: MOPITT, maybe OMI, maybe GEMS, maybe MODIS Ocean Color? 

---

### What should I know before running these scripts?
Before you run any scripts, make sure you have the following libraries:

- Numpy, scipy, matplotlib
- Xarray
- NetCDF4
- Geopandas + Shapely

If you have any questions or concerns about the provided scripts, please contact me at jyyoon@uw.edu. Any updates to the satellite L2 files may break the script, so use at your own risk.
