# Satellite Remote Sensing in Python

Here is a repository of all of my satellite/remote sensing processing scripts! :-)

Currently, there are scripts for:

- TROPOMI: Methane, Water/HDO, Sulfur Dioxide, Formaldehyde, and Nitrogen Dioxide
- Vegetation Indices: Work-in-progress, but will have SIF, SIF (downscaled), and VIIRS NDVI/NIR. Maybe CCI?
- N/A: MOPITT, maybe OMI, maybe GEMS, maybe MODIS Ocean Color? 

If you have any questions or concerns about the provided scripts, please contact me at jyyoon@uw.edu.
